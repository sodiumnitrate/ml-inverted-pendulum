# ml-inverted-pendulum

A project based on [the inverted pendulum project here](https://www.instructables.com/Inverted-Pendulum-Control-Theory-and-Dynamics/).

*Note*: this is incomplete and a work in progress and therefore not guaranteed to work.


## List of materials (incomplete)
- Two PVC pipes cut to equal length (we are using diameter ~34mm)
- A gyro+accelerometer (we are using MPU-9250)
- M3 screws
- 608 2RS bearings
- 3D printed parts (see below)
- GT2 pulleys and belt
- stepper motor

#### 3D printed parts
The `.stl` files can be found [here](parts_3d_print).

- 2x gantry roller
- 4x end caps
- 1x stepper bracket
- 2x idle pulley bearing holder
- 1x pendulum holder
- 2x belt attachment
- 1x [pendulum bearing holder (a)](parts_3d_print/PendulumBearingHolder_a.stl)
- 1x pendulum bearing holder (b)
- 1x pulley hole spacer
- 4x bearing hole spacer
- 1x gantry plate
- 1x stepper holder plate
- 1x idle pulley holder plate
- 1x pendulum (a)
- 1x pendulum (b)

The pendulum can also be laser cut from a 4mm thick material (TODO: add `.dwg` file).
